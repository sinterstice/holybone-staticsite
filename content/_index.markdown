Welcome to our website! We are a theater production company based out of Rochester, New York, producing immersive theater experiences.

Our first production is **MINISTRY** for Rochester Fringe. It is an immersive theater experience set in a surgical demonstration, in a time of great scientific promise. **It will be performed at The Spirit Room at 11:30 on September 12th, 13th, 18th & 19th**. Tickets are available online **[here](https://rochesterfringe.com/tickets-and-shows/ministry-or-the-surgical-revelation)**.
